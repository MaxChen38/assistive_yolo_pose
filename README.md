# assistive_yolo_pose
This project integrates YOLOv9 and OpenPose to develop a computer vision system that detects assistive devices (e.g., wheelchairs, canes) and human pose. It is designed for smart transportation applications to assist in real-time identification of mobility-impaired individuals at bus stops.
